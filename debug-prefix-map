# Purpose: Generates on standard output a suitable "-fdebug-prefix-map=OLD=NEW" switch which causes the
# DWARF information to contain the correct paths to the source files even though we compile in an environment
# where tup has union-mounted the source directory hiearchy under the build directory hieararchy via userfs. Although
# this is useful for building, it causes all kinds of problems for runtime tools that need to use DWARF to find the
# source code (debuggers, profilers, mainenance tools, etc.).

# The first argument says how far up in the directory hieararchy to get to the tup build root.
